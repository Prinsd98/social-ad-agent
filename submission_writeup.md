## Track
Concierge Agents

## Problem
Brands waste hours manually creating social media ad creatives, captions, schedules, and performance checks.

## Solution
A fully automated multi-agent system that:
1. Generates ad creatives  
2. Writes captions & CTA  
3. Schedules posting  
4. Simulates performance  
5. Stores winning patterns in memory  

## Key Concepts Used
- Multi-agent system (creative, copy, scheduler, analytics)  
- Memory Bank (long-term learning)  
- Tool abstraction (LLM tool + stat tool)  
- Context passing  
- Observability (logs + metrics)  

## Impact
Cuts campaign creation time from hours → **30 seconds**.
